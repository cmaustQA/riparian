# Riparian Cypress Example

This project is a set of Cypress tests for the Riparian front page. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of various elements on the website, such as navigation links and buttons.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Cypress, a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework, is also required.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner. You can then click on the test file you want to run.

## Test Cases

The tests are organized into two contexts:

1. **Navigation link checks**: These tests verify that the navigation links in the navbar are correctly linked to their respective pages.
2. **Button presence and link checks**: These tests verify that the buttons on the front page are present and correctly linked to their respective pages.
